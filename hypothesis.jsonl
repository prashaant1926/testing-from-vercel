{"id":"h005","assumption":"Machine learning models must trade off between bias and variance - reducing one necessarily increases the other","hypothesis":"Bias-variance independence is achievable through meta-learning architectures that dynamically adjust model complexity based on local data characteristics","impact":"Could invalidate fundamental ML theory and enable models that are simultaneously low-bias and low-variance","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:30:04.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h006","assumption":"Network reliability issues in distributed systems must be handled through redundancy, replication, and fault-tolerance mechanisms","hypothesis":"Failure-embracing systems can outperform fault-tolerant ones by treating failures as information sources rather than problems to be solved","impact":"Challenges the entire field of reliable distributed systems and could enable new paradigms of anti-fragile computing","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:30:05.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"h007","assumption":"User interface design should provide clear affordances and intuitive mappings between actions and outcomes","hypothesis":"Ambiguous interfaces can enhance user engagement and learning by requiring active interpretation and discovery of functionality","impact":"Could revolutionize interface design by showing that confusion and uncertainty can be beneficial rather than detrimental","timestamp":"2025-08-19T23:30:06.000Z","status":"proposed"}
