# Research Concept & Direction

## Overview

This research challenges fundamental assumptions across computer science domains that may be limiting progress and innovation. Following the assumption + hypothesis paradigm, we identify widely-accepted beliefs in Machine Learning, Systems, and Human-Computer Interaction research and propose inversions that could unlock new research directions.

**Problem Statement**: Computer science research is constrained by implicit assumptions that span entire literature domains. These assumptions, while historically useful, may now limit our ability to develop breakthrough solutions that address modern computational challenges.

**Research Objective**: To systematically identify and challenge literature-level assumptions across CS domains, generating impactful hypotheses that could reshape how we approach fundamental problems in computing.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Assumption Identification**: What fundamental assumptions underlie modern computer science research across ML, Systems, and HCI domains that are rarely questioned?

2. **Hypothesis Generation**: How can we invert these assumptions to create novel research directions that challenge existing paradigms?

3. **Impact Assessment**: Which assumption inversions would affect the broadest swath of existing work and unlock the most significant research opportunities?

4. **Validation Strategy**: What experimental approaches could effectively test these challenging hypotheses across different CS domains?

## Methodology

**Phase 1: Literature-Level Analysis**
- Systematic review of seminal papers across ML, Systems, and HCI domains
- Identification of implicit assumptions that span multiple papers within each domain
- Documentation of assumption origins and their propagation through literature

**Phase 2: Assumption Inversion Process**
- Application of the "assumption + hypothesis" methodology
- Generation of counter-assumptions that challenge existing paradigms
- Assessment of potential impact using the "affects broad swath of work" criterion

**Phase 3: Hypothesis Validation Framework**
- Design of experiments that test core assumptions rather than incremental improvements
- Development of evaluation metrics appropriate to each domain's standards of evidence
- Creation of failure-fast validation strategies to maximize learning velocity

**Research Approach**: We follow the Computer Science-inspired template: "Prior work assumes X → We propose Y → This matters because Z", ensuring each hypothesis has clear theoretical grounding and practical implications for the field.
